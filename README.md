These are the relevent files from a web application I worked on. I did minor changes to a lot of these files but I will highlight the work I spent the most time on.

Controllers:

I worked on the Networking controller to make it display information sorted by different catagories based on user input.

On the JPBulletins contoller, I created the Meetup PartialViewResult to get data from Meetup.com's API. 

In the snapshot viewModel controller, I made the export function update the contacts table of the database. 

Views:

I styled large parts of the layout partial view to be more consistent with the rest of the project, removing some in line styling in the process.

I re-styled several tables to display information correctly, including the ones on the index view of the JPHires controller and the networking view of the networking controller.
